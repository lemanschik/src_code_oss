# src_code_oss
Offical Repository of the Code OSS Project.

## Why?
The build process from microsoft creates a isolated none modular none reuseable build they also generate none easy reuseable modules.
Thats why we hardFork as also we want to create a Code OSS version without the name Microsoft in it Microsoft is not even allowed to
contribute or make any opions as a Company. All Individuals are invited to contribute under The Unlicense. Microsoft needs to get excluded
from commits and merges so that they can not claim that this uses Any code of them. They are free to Fork this and depend on it so same as with
chromium.
